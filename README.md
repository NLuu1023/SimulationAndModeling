Simulation and Modeling
This repository include a variety of small programs demonstrating the steps and processes of many different types of sims. The sims included are as follows:

TIME STEP SIMULATION: 

1. Paperboy sim - simulating the sales of newspapers for the next 1000 days while calculating the avarage, variance, and standard deviation. 

2. Tree acres sim - simulating amount of trees being planted and dying due to factors such as fire, drought, bacteria, etc... for the next 100 years. 

3. Ice cream parlor sim - simulating the sales of ice cream gallons per week for 10 years factoring in the effects of seasons and the accuracy of gallons delivered.

4. Hospital Emergency Room sim - simulating the stats of patients (heart, gastro, and bleeding) treated and died in 100 hours.

5. Muscle cell infection sim - simulation a muscle tissue's growth of infected cells.
